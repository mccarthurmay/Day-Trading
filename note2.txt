Yes, what you're describing is a form of high-frequency trading (HFT) or market making, where traders attempt to profit from small price discrepancies by executing trades at very high speeds. This strategy is a bit more sophisticated than just buying from someone willing to sell at a lower price and then immediately selling at a higher price, but the core idea is quite similar.

Here’s how high-frequency trading and related strategies work in this context:

1. Arbitrage Opportunities:
Traders often seek to take advantage of price differences between various exchanges or market venues. For instance, if there’s a price discrepancy between a stock’s price on a public exchange and a dark pool or another market, a trader might buy the stock at a lower price in the dark pool (or a private exchange) and then sell it on a public exchange at the higher market price. This is a form of arbitrage, which attempts to exploit inefficiencies in pricing.
High-frequency traders are particularly good at spotting and acting on these small price discrepancies in milliseconds. They use algorithms to track price movements and execute trades faster than any human could.
2. Market Making:
Market makers are traders who provide liquidity by placing both buy and sell orders for stocks, often at very tight bid-ask spreads (the difference between the buy and sell price). The idea is to profit off the spread by buying at a slightly lower price (the bid) and selling at a slightly higher price (the ask).
In a high-frequency context, market makers are constantly buying and selling shares at high speeds, looking to profit from these small price movements. They often hold inventories of shares and use algorithms to adjust their orders quickly to avoid large losses and to capitalize on the spread.
3. Liquidity Provision:
High-frequency traders and market makers often provide liquidity in the market, meaning they stand ready to buy or sell at any given time. In some cases, they will buy shares that others want to sell (potentially at a price below market) and sell them to others at market price.
This is different from what you might be thinking of, where someone just buys a share at a "discounted" price from someone else and immediately sells it at the market price. High-frequency trading strategies involve much faster execution and typically scale up these types of trades to exploit minuscule price differences across markets or platforms.
4. Latency Arbitrage:
A subset of high-frequency trading involves latency arbitrage, where traders take advantage of delays in data transmission between markets. For example, if a news release or price movement happens in one exchange, HFT systems try to exploit the small window of time it takes for that information to reach other exchanges and price feeds.
In this case, the trader might buy from one exchange where the price hasn't yet adjusted, and then sell on another exchange where the price has already moved, profiting from the lag in price adjustment.
5. Ping Orders & Rebate Arbitrage:
Ping orders are used by some high-frequency traders as a way to test liquidity. They send small orders to see if they can buy or sell at a price that is better than the market. If a hit is received at a favorable price (like a price lower than market), they may immediately execute larger trades.
In certain cases, high-frequency traders also participate in rebate arbitrage. Exchanges often offer rebates to market makers for providing liquidity. High-frequency traders use these rebates as part of their strategy, buying at slightly lower prices and quickly reselling at higher prices, while capturing the rebate as part of their profits.
6. Strategies Used:
Scalping: High-frequency traders may use scalping strategies, where they attempt to profit from tiny price movements over and over again. This involves buying and selling quickly, sometimes holding positions for just seconds or milliseconds, trying to capture small but frequent profits.
Statistical Arbitrage: This strategy involves using sophisticated mathematical models to identify potential mispricings between related stocks or markets, and then executing quick trades to exploit the differences before the market corrects itself.
7. Do Retail Traders Do This?:
Generally, this kind of trading is dominated by institutions or firms with access to advanced technology, faster execution speeds, and high capital. Retail traders usually don't have the same infrastructure (e.g., colocation with exchanges, high-speed algorithms, and access to private liquidity venues) that institutional high-frequency traders do.
However, retail traders can still engage in day trading and scalping, although the execution speed and access to sophisticated algorithms are much more limited for them compared to large HFT firms.
8. Is It Legal?:
High-frequency trading is legal, but it must follow strict regulations, especially to ensure there is no market manipulation. Activities like spoofing (placing fake orders to manipulate the price) or front-running (trading on non-public information before others can react) are illegal.
The use of ping orders or other strategies to test the market for liquidity is not inherently illegal, as long as the trader is not attempting to manipulate the market or engage in activities like spoofing or insider trading.
9. Risks Involved:
While high-frequency strategies can be profitable, they also carry risks. For instance, if market conditions change rapidly, traders might get caught in positions that are hard to exit. Additionally, if large institutional traders or algorithms are using similar strategies, it can create competition and make it harder to profit.
There's also the risk of liquidity shocks, where a market moves quickly and there’s not enough liquidity to execute trades at favorable prices.
Summary:
Yes, high-frequency traders or market makers often buy from people willing to sell at lower-than-market prices (e.g., in dark pools, private exchanges, or other venues) and then sell at the market price. This is part of strategies like arbitrage, scalping, or market-making, where they capitalize on tiny price differences through rapid trading. These strategies usually require advanced technology and fast execution speeds, which is why they are typically used by institutional traders or large trading firms.

For retail traders, while you can engage in day trading or scalping, you won't generally have the same access to the tools that high-frequency traders use to execute these strategies at the speeds required for optimal profits.
